# TODO Items
- [x] Create an example Settings page
- [x] Create an example Command
- [ ] Get tests working
  - `browserTest` is excluded which seems to exclude `test` as well 
- [ ] Make repository a Template
- [x] Can `index.html` be removed?
- [ ] Replace basic settings check with version check

## Obsidian API Bindings
- [ ] Pull in the full CodeMirror bindings generated by Dukat
  - [ ] Need to fix the missing `Partial` class that is referenced
- [ ] Integrate Dukat into the build process
  - Uses the `generateExternals = true` directive on the `implementation(npm(...))` dependency which tags the Dukat output as generated source.
  - `lib.dom.kt` currently produces a ton of errors (haven't investigated at all), so this is a wishlist item for now
- [ ] Turn Obsidian bindings into a library on its own?
- [ ] Fix `DevTools failed to load SourceMap: Could not parse content for app://obsidian.md/main.js.map: Unexpected end of JSON input` in console
- [ ] Figure out how to use `app.workspace.getActiveViewOfType`
